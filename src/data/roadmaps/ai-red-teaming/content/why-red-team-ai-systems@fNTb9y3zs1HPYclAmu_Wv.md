# Why Red Team AI Systems?

AI systems introduce novel risks beyond traditional software, such as emergent unintended capabilities, complex failure modes, susceptibility to subtle data manipulations, and potential for large-scale misuse (e.g., generating disinformation). AI Red Teaming is necessary because standard testing methods often fail to uncover these unique AI vulnerabilities. It provides critical, adversary-focused insights needed to build genuinely safe, reliable, and secure AI before deployment.
