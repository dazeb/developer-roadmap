# Reinforcement Learning

Red teaming RL-based AI systems involves testing for vulnerabilities such as reward hacking (exploiting the reward function to induce unintended behavior), unsafe exploration (agent takes harmful actions during learning), or susceptibility to adversarial perturbations in the environment's state. Understanding the agent's policy and value functions is crucial for designing effective tests against RL agents.
